# TodoApp
I created a firebase account but was having trouble pushing and pulling information from firebase to the app.  I copied the API keys but I was having trouble reading the supporting documentation to get it all up and going.  I included a screenshot so you can see my account and DB.

For the second I was able to configure the router, I was able to load Todos, I was able to add new Todos, but I was not able to update them and have the buttons change active colors.
