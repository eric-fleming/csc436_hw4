# TodoApp
I created a firebase account online.  I read the link, but that tutorial was an old API, like 2 years old, so I ended up getting confused. I was having trouble pushing and pulling information from firebase to the app.  I was able to copy the API keys but I don't think that was the issue.  I included a screenshot so you can see that I created my account and database.

For the second assignment I had similar Firebase problems.  I was able to configure the router, I was able to load Todos, I was able to add new Todos, but I was not able to update them and have the buttons change active colors.  Again I feel like I need more concrete and explicit patterns for how to call information down from Firebase.  I am going to keep trying to figure it out in the mean time.
